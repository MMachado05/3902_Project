# Guidelines & Best Practices

## Naming Conventions

- *Pull Requests, Issues, Commits*: Brief single-sentence descriptor in an active imperative voice.
e.g. "Create Static Sprite for MC"
- *Branches*: Lowercase, hyphens for spaces.
- *Code*: Follow C# naming conventions as specified in Carmen.

## Code Reviews

At least 2 reviewers for *every* Pull Requests (PR). 
Reviewers should build and run to ensure no errors.
Feedback should be documented (whether errors are found or not) as comments, code comments preferred.

## Task & Priorities
Anecdotally called "Jira Boards", a template under the "3902" has been created and should be used for all Tasks. 
Each Task should have an assigned priority at the beginning of every Sprint:

P1: Critical
Critical issues should be addressed as soon as possible.

P2: Important
Important Tasks are those that major functions of the game depend on. 

P3: Relevant
Relevant Tasks are those that are not crucial but must be completed.

P4: Enhancments
Enhancments are tasks not required for a Sprint, but if time allows can be implemented.

## Communication

Discussion for each Task/Issue should mainly be kept on Github. 
For historical reasons, Tasks should be marked as Done when completed, never deleted.
